Hey everyone! Please create a folder of your name and commit in the same. We hope we can learn and grow together!

## For beginners
Hi! Please don't feel overwhelmed. Go at your own pace. Learn from the resources mentioned below. You can commit what you learn and try to solve the questions mentioned below as you progress.

For those who are in doubt what language to choose, we suggest starting with C++ for the basics such as **variables, conditionals, loops, functions etc**. Once you are familiar with the concepts choose any other language if you wish to, though we suggest to use java.
