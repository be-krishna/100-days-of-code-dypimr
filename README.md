Hey everyone! Please create a folder of your name and commit in the same. We hope we can learn and grow together!

## For beginners
Hi! Please don't feel overwhelmed. Go at your own pace. Learn from the resources mentioned below. You can commit what you learn and try to solve the questions mentioned below as you progress.

For those who are in doubt what language to choose, we suggest starting with C++ for the basics such as **variables, conditionals, loops, functions etc**. Once you are familiar with the concepts choose any other language if you wish to, though we suggest to use java.

## Questions
### Day 1
1. Input a year and find wether it is a leap year or not.
2. Take two numbers and print the sum of both.
3. Take a number as input and print the multiplication table for it.
4. Take two numbers as inputs and find their HCF and LCM.
5. Keep taking numbers as inputs till the user enters 'x', after that print the sum of all.

### Day 2
1. Write a program to print whether a number is even or odd, also take input.
2. Take name as input and print a greeting message for that name.
3. Write a program to input principal, time, and rate (P, T, R) from the user and find Simple Interest.

### Day 3
1. The table below describes how the grade for a particular course is determined. Write a program that gives a course grade according to the provided table.

   | points | grade       |
   | ------ | ----------- |
   | < 0    | impossible! |
   | 0-49   | failed      |
   | 50-59  | 1           |
   | 60-69  | 2           |
   | 70-79  | 3           |
   | 80-89  | 4           |
   | 90-100 | 5           |
   | > 100  | incredible! |
   
   Sample outputs:
   ```
   Give points [0-100]:
   37
   Grade: failed
   ```
   ```
   Give points [0-100]:
   -3
   Grade: impossible!
   ```
2. Write a program that prompts the user for a number between one and one hundred, and prints that number. If the number is divisible by three, then print "Fizz" instead of the number. If the number is divisible by five, then print "Buzz" instead of the number. If the number is divisible by both three and five, then print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

   Sample outputs:
   ```
   2
   2

   5
   Buzz

   30
   FizzBuzz
   ```
3. Write a program that reads values from the user until they input a 0. After this, the program prints the total number of inputted values. The zero that's used to exit the loop should not be included in the total number count.

### Day 4
Today we will have only one question which has 5 parts
1. Implement a program that asks the user for numbers (the program first prints "Write numbers: ") until the user gives the number -1. When the user writes -1, the program prints "Thx! Bye!" and ends.
    ```
    Give numbers:
    5
    2
    4
    -1
    Thx! Bye!
    ```
2. Extend the program so that it prints the sum of the numbers (not including the -1) the user has written.
    ```
    Give numbers:
    5
    2
    4
    -1
    Thx! Bye!
    Sum: 11
    ```
3. Extend the program so that it also prints the number of numbers (not including the -1) the user has written.
    ```
    Give numbers:
    5
    2
    4
    -1
    Thx! Bye!
    Sum: 11
    Numbers: 3
    ```
4. Extend the program so that it prints the mean of the numbers (not including the -1) the user has written.
    ```
    Give numbers:
    5
    2
    4
    -1
    Thx! Bye!
    Sum: 11
    Numbers: 3
    Average: 3.666666666666
    ```
5. Extend the program so that it prints the number of even and odd numbers (excluding the -1).
    ```
    Give numbers:
    5
    2
    4
    -1
    Thx! Bye!
    Sum: 11
    Numbers: 3
    Average: 3.666666666666
    Even: 2
    Odd: 1
   ```

### Day 5

1.Write a program that prompts the user to input an integer and then outputs the number with the digits reversed. For example, if the input   is 12345, the output should be 54321.

2.Write a program to print Fibonacci series of n terms where n is input by user :
    0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 24 ..... 

3.Write a program to calculate the sum of following series where n is input by user. 
     1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + 1/5 +…………1/n
